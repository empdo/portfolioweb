This is my first time creating a pcb and I am a amature at best. Some of the technical content in this post might be incorrect and the rest can probably me optimized, though i have learnt a lot from this project and I am very pleased with the final product.

<h2 id="title">The PCB</h2>
<div id="title">
At first my plan for this keyboard was to use a regular development board, like the rp2040 zero or pi pico, as many commercial split keyboards do. This would have been a easy way to do it but it felt unnecessary to order a pcb just to hold a regular development board. Instead I choose to try and make my own circut with the rp2040. 

Since I have never done a pcb design before choose to base my design very heavily of the typical design featured in the rp2040s datasheet.
